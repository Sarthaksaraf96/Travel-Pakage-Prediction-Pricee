## Project Workflow
#### Data Collection and Preparation:
- Dataset Link : [dataset link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQPD_UG5C6YfvduVlX7PckwVwGuBnCBw/view)
- Gather travel package data, including features such as destination, duration, and amenities.
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

#### Feature Engineering:
- Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Use techniques like scaling and normalization to prepare the features for modeling.

#### Model Development:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Develop a machine learning model, such as linear regression or decision tree regression, to predict travel package prices.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
